Valhalla is an open source routing engine and accompanying libraries for use with Open Street Map data. The demos repository serves as a sort of scratch pad which can be used to test and demo different pieces of the valhalla organization working together to accomplish their various tasks.

Building
--------

Each demo, if needed, will provide its own instructions on building and testing.

Using
-----

For detailed information about what types of things are contained within the demos repository, please see the more [detailed documentation](docs/index.md).

You are free to use any of the demos for your own projects. The demos, and all of the projects under the Valhalla organization use the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).

Contributing
------------

We welcome contributions to the demos. If you would like to report an issue, or even better fix an existing one, please use the [demos issue tracker](https://github.com/valhalla/demos/issues) on GitHub.

If you would like to make an improvement to the code, please be aware that all valhalla projects are written mostly in C++11, in the K&R (1TBS variant) with two spaces as indentation. We generally follow this [c++ style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html). We welcome contributions as pull requests to the [repository](https://github.com/valhalla/demos) and highly recommend that your pull request include a test to validate the addition/change of functionality.
